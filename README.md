# Sudoku solver

This is a React App scaffolded with Vite that lets you solve a sudoku board using a backtracking algorithm. One can decide to visualize the solving steps of the algorithm or directly show the solved board. Part of the solving algorithm is inspired by this [Medium Blog](https://itznur07.medium.com/solving-sudoku-puzzles-a-step-by-step-guide-with-javascript-code-examples-55199474de7e) on solving sudoku puzzles using Javascript.
